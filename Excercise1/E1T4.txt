Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

1. The IAM role has full access to S3 buckets. It should least privilege access permissions

2. Public and private subnet ACL rules are allow all traffics from all ports. They should reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet
