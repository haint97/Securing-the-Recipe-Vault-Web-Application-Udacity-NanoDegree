- What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
	Using AWS Systems Manager to login to the instance could  remove all external access to the instances.
- Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
	Creating VPC private endpoints for S3 will not prevent unauthorized access to the private bucket while IAM permissions are insecure.
- Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
	Enabling default encryption will not encrypt objects that are already in the bucket. These objects needs to be downloaded and uploaded again.
- The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
	The origin template would revert the stack back to the old insecure configuration. These changes will be overriden by next cloud formation stack deployment.
